# PhonePe Pulse Data Visualization and Exploration

## Objective
The aim of this project is to develop a solution that extracts, transforms, and visualizes data from the PhonePe Pulse GitHub repository.

## Project Steps

### Data Extraction
- Scripting to clone the repository and collect data.

### Data Transformation
- Using Python and Pandas to clean and structure the data.

### Database Insertion
- Storing transformed data in a PostgreSQL database.

### Dashboard Creation
- Using Streamlit and Plotly to build an interactive dashboard.

### Data Retrieval
- Fetching data from the database to dynamically update the dashboard.

## Results
The project successfully created an interactive dashboard that allows users to explore PhonePe Pulse data in a detailed and user-friendly manner.

## Challenges
- Data Cleaning: Handling inconsistencies and ensuring data integrity during the transformation phase.
- Database Management: Efficiently storing and retrieving large datasets from PostgreSQL.
- Interactive Dashboard: Ensuring real-time updates and smooth interaction within the Streamlit and Plotly environment.

## Impact
This project enhances the understanding of PhonePe Pulse data by providing a clear and interactive platform to explore various metrics and trends.

## Future Work
- Enhanced Visualizations: Incorporating more complex visualizations and analytics.
- Scalability: Improving the system to handle larger datasets and more complex queries.
- User Experience: Adding more features to the dashboard for a better user experience, such as custom queries and predictive analytics.
